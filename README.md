Vulnerabilities:
------------------------
```
Level 1: Integer overflow
Level 2: Stack overflow
Level 3: Array overflow
Level 4: Off by one
Level 5: Stack cookie
Level 6: Format string
Level 7: Heap overflow
Level 8: Structure redirection / Type confusion
Level 9: Zero pointers
Level 10: Command injection
Level 11: Path Traversal
Level 12: Return oriented programming (ROP)
Level 13: Use-after-free
Level 14: Jump oriented programming (JOP)
```

Install on Debian/Ubuntu System:
------------------------------------------------------
   Install needed tools on host (Ubuntu)
   ```
   ~$ cd exploit_me
   ~/exploit_me $ ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```
   
   Some problems you may meet and their corresponding solutions:
   ```
   (1) pip or pip3 command not found: sudo apt-get update
   (2) Permission denied: sudo chmod +x exploit
   (3) ...
   ```
   
Usage hints:
------------
- See hints.txt for a start.

- For trying if it works :
  *** 32-Bit:
    ```
    $ ./bin/exploit
    ```
  *** 64-Bit:
    ```
    $ ./bin/exploit64
    ```
- Example debugging session:
  ```
  $ sudo ./scripts/disableaslr.sh
  ```
  (Disable aslr, don't run if you want more fun)
  (Path dir1/dir2 needed in current exploit directory for Path Traversal vulnerability)
  
  In first terminal:
  ------------------
  *** 32-Bit:
    ```
    $ ./bin/arm exploit [levelpassword] [options] &
    $ gdb-multiarch ./exploit
    pwndbg> set architecture arm
    ```
	  instead you can also add architecture in .gdbinit as "set architecture arm"
	
  *** 64-Bit:
    ```
    $ ./arm64 exploit64 [levelpassword] [options] &
    $ gdb-multiarch ./exploit64
    pwndbg> set architecture aarch64
    ```
    instead you can also add architecture in .gdbinit as "set architecture aarch64"
	
  *** Example .gdbinit
    ```
    set endian little
    #set architecture arm
    #set architecture aarch64
    target remote :1234

    ```

- GDB Basics: 
  ``` 
  Use 
  "si" to step into functions or 
  "so" to step over functions, 
  "info functions" to print all functions,
  "p [function]" to print function address and information, if symbols exist
  "b [function]" (Example: "b main" to set a breakpoint and "b *0x1234" to set a breakpoint at addr 0x1234, 
  "c" to continue program, 
  "x/[dwords]x" to print offsets, for example "x/4x 0x1234" and 
  "x/[dwords]x $reg" to print register contents, for example "x/4x $sp". 
  Using pwndbg, you can use 
  "rop" to list rop gadgets, for example "rop --grep 'pop {r3'" to list gadgets which pop values from stack to r3. 
  See https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/blob/dev/FEATURES.md for more details !
  ```

- After you've exploited correctly, you will see the password for the next level.
  So if level2 password would be "Level2":
  *** 32-Bit:
    ```
    $ ./bin/exploit Level2
    ```
  *** 64-Bit:
    ```
    $ ./bin/exploit64 Level2
    ```
